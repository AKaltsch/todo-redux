# TODO list with REDUX and Google Auth

## Description ##
I created this app as a way to demonstrate my understanding of both Redux and Google Authentication. The app itself is just a simple todo list but it is my first project where I have put my newly learned understanding of Redux with React.js into practice. In the app you can create, read, update, and delete "todos" from a list on the applications homepage. You are only allowed access to perform these actions when you are signed in through google authentication. Otherwise, you are only able to see the list. Page was styled with semantic UI CSS stylesheet
